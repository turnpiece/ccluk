= How does it work? =

The Import Export WordPress Users Plugin takes CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file as input. You must create a CSV file and enter the user details in a structured format as explained in the tutorial. This is to match each field of CSV file to the field of particular user fields, otherwise, Admin needs to input manually. For example, the user_email field gets mapped to the User Email. For the plugin to work correctly, you must map headers of all the column correctly and you must ensure that all of the fields you enter is in the correct format.

You can create the CSV from the scratch or you can export the users to get the format of CSV. You can use a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice, Libre office, or Google Spreadsheets for creating and modifying the CSV file. Save this file in UTF-8 encoding with extension .CSV. After entering all details about users in a spreadsheet, you can bulk import users to WordPress. With this plugin, you can also export and download user details as a CSV file.

More information about the set up of the plugin and a sample CSV that is taken as input by the plugin is given in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.webtoffee.com/user-import-export-plugin-wordpress-user-guide/">WordPress Users & WooCommerce Customers Import Export Plugin - User Guide.</a>
