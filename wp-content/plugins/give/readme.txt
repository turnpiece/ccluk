= Who Uses Give? =

With more than 40,000+ active installs of Give, we hear more and more success stories from nonprofit organizations using Give. Causes are using Give to raise millions of dollars per year. Check out some of our [Give Stories](http://bit.ly/WPORGGiveStories) and [Case Studies](http://bit.ly/WPORGGiveCaseStudies) for details about their success.

= Why Use Give for Donations? =

If your nonprofit or cause depends on donations, you want to treat your donors right. Don't send them through a shopping cart or kick them off-site to a third-party platform. Give streamlines the giving process by allowing your donors to complete their donations directly on your website using an easy to complete donation form. As an admin, you have the customization options and reporting and donor management features you need in order to run successful giving campaigns.

You may have struggled with other WordPress donation plugins in the past; dealing with the lack of features, documentation, and support can be a real pain. There's a better way. Now you have Give and our entire team on *your* side.

= Simple and Pain-Free Giving =

Our development and support team built Give from day one with best practices in WordPress development and online giving in mind. Give works great -- the "WordPress way" so you're already familiar with the interface once you begin using it.

The strength of Give lies within its optimized donation forms. When creating a form you may specify whether the form is a single or multi-level amounts. As well, you can allow donors to give a custom amount if you wish. The donation forms can then be displayed anywhere on your website using a shortcode, widget, or the single donation form page. Simply install and activate the plugin to get started.

= First Time Users =

For new users, we suggest reviewing our [documentation](http://bit.ly/WPORGDocs "Visit the Give docs") to get an understanding of how the plugin works. If you run into any trouble, we offer [free support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/give "Visit the Give support page on WordPress.org") to help you with your issues, questions, and concerns.

If you are a Give customer with an active license of any of our popular add-ons, we'd love to hear from you and support you via our [Priority Support channel](http://bit.ly/WPORGGiveSupport).

= Zero Commission Charges =

Give's goal is to "Democratize Generosity." We want to make it easy for *everyone* to raise funds online. The money you raise using Give is yours to support your cause. Period. We are supported through the sale of [premium Give add-ons](http://bit.ly/WPORGGiveAddons "View all of Give's Premium Add-ons"). Add-ons enable advanced features that enable you to extend the functionality of Give.

For example, you can use one of our add-ons to accept funds through your favorite [payment gateway](http://bit.ly/WPORGGivePaymentGateways), enable [recurring donations](http://bit.ly/WPORGGiveRecurring), or send donor emails to your favorite email marketing platform. [View all of Give's Add-ons](http://bit.ly/WPORGGiveAddons "View all Give add-ons") to discover all the ways you can further enhance and extend Give.

= Easy to Customize and Enhance =

Give is built by [Impress.org](https://impress.org/ "Visit the developers of Give - Impress.org"), our plugins are built from the ground up to be intuitive and easy to use. By following along with our [Getting Started Guide](http://docs.givewp.com/give101 "Give 101 - Getting started using Give to accept donations on WordPress"), setting up Give to accept donations on WordPress is simple and easy.

Are you a developer? Give is fully extendable. We built in an advanced templating system similar to the ones found in many of WordPress' top plugins that makes customizing many of Give's frontend elements upgrade proof and extremely flexible. Run into some trouble? We're here to help! Along with the plugin is a support team that is dedicated, fast to respond, and always willing to squash bugs and help troubleshoot.

Here's some great developer-oriented tutorials and docs to help you customize Give to your liking:

Here's a few ways you can contribute to Give:

* Star/fork/watch the [Give GitHub repository](https://github.com/impress-org/Give "Visit the Give GitHub Repo") to learn more about what issues we're tackling and the project is developing.

== Upgrade Notice ==

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.8 or greater
* PHP version 5.6 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0.15 or greater
* Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)
* cURL version 5.40 or higher
* An SSL certificate -- while this is not strictly required, it is highly recommend. If you are converting your site to use SSL/HTTPS now, [we have a detailed guide to help you here](http://docs.givewp.com/ssl).

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Give, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New".

In the search field type "Give" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our donation plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I learn more about how to use Give? =

We have extensive documentation on installing and configuring Give [on our website](http://bit.ly/WPORGDocs). We suggest starting with the [Give 101 article](http://bit.ly/WPORGGive101).

= How can I get support for Give? =

We work hard to the best support possible for Give. The [WordPress.org Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/give) is used for free community based support. We continually monitor the forum and do our best to ensure everyone gets a response.

[Priority support](http://bit.ly/WPORGGiveSupport) is given to users who have an active license for one of Give's [Add-ons](http://bit.ly/WPORGGiveAddons) or [Bundles](http://bit.ly/WPROGGiveBundles). We provide email-based support to our Premium Add-on customers with an average response time of under 2 hours and average time to resolution of 24-48 hours depending on the severity of the issue.

= Do you have any demos? =

Yes! We have several live examples of Give and the wide variety of form options you can use with Give. Check out [our Demos here](http://bit.ly/WPORGGiveDemos).

= Do you have Case Studies of Nonprofits using Give? =

Yes! We have two different types of studies that highlight nonprofits in different ways.
"Give Stories" are stories of how nonprofits or individuals implemented Give with success. [You can read them all here](http://bit.ly/WPORGGiveStories).
"Case Studies" are more detailed examples of how an agency implemented Give for a specific purpose for an organization. [You can read those here](http://bit.ly/WPORGGiveCaseStudies).

= How is Give better than a form plugin for accepting donations through WordPress? =

Form plugins are excellent solutions for general intake forms. That said, they most often lack substantial donation reporting features, and donor management options. They also lack a variety of presentation options like Give has for embedding your forms in different places throughout your site. If you want a "Donate Now!" button in the header of your site that opens in a modal, you'll most often have to do quite a bit of customization to get that working just right with form plugins -- but not with Give.

Give works great alongside all the most popular form plugins. Use Give for donations, and Caldera Forms, Ninja Forms, Gravity Forms or other for your general purpose intake forms. They'll work great alongside each other.

= How is Give better than an eCommerce plugin for accepting donations on WordPress? =

We actually built Give specifically to overcome many of the hurdles you have to go through in order to get an eCommerce plugin (like WooCommerce) to be streamlined for donations. You want to treat your donors right. No donor wants to add their donation to a cart and go through several page refreshes just to type their information in. You, as the site admin, don't want to have to change the word "Products" to "Donations" everywhere, and go through all the hoops of removing taxes and shipping either.

On top of that, customizing the plugin's terminology is a daunting task. You never want your users to receive an "invoice" for the donation "product" they "purchased". Rather, you'd like for them to receive a receipt for the donation they gave.

Use Give for donations, and let WooCommerce or WP eCommerce or the like handle your products. They work alongside each other just fine. Your donors will be happy, your customers will be happy, and so will you.

== Screenshots ==

1. This is an example of a simple, yet powerful, donation form that allows the user to input a custom amount.

2. Creating powerful donation forms is easy with Give. Simply install the plugin, create a new donation form, set the desired giving options, and publish!

3. Donation form fields can appear within a modal window (as shown here), be revealed with a nice sliding animation, or display entirely on the page (default).

4. Give makes the donation process simple and easy for your donors. This helps maximize conversion rates and further empower your cause.

5. The multi-level donation amount functionality allows you to set different giving levels for your donors to choose from. In addition, you can allow donors to specify custom donation amounts and even set donation goals.

6. The admin view of a donation form with multi-level amounts configured. Give's flexible options allow you to control whether the amounts output as radio buttons, a select field, or input buttons.

7. Don't need donation levels? No problem. You can set a default amount and allow your donor's to configure a custom donation amount to create a simple, yet powerful, donation form.

8. In-depth donation reports allow you to track just how much your cause has raised over time. You can even export the data to CSV or PDF formats.

9. Extend Give with a robust suite of powerful [Add-ons](https://givewp.com/addons "View all Give Add-ons"). Accept recurring donations, credit cards, add custom form fields, and more!

10. Give is thoroughly [documented](https://givewp.com/documentation "Visit the Give documentation") to help you get started quickly and learn basic to advanced features and functionalities.

11. Give has a dedicated support team to help answer any questions you may have and help you through stumbling blocks.
