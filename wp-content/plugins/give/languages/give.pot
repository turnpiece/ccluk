#: includes/admin/welcome.php:313
msgid "Give is driven by its powerful donation form building features. However, it is much more than just a \"donation form.\" From the \"Add Form\" page you'll be able to choose how and where you want to receive your donations. You will also be able to set the preferred donation amounts."
msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/welcome.php:315

msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/welcome.php:334
msgid "Each donation form you create can be customized to receive either a pre-determined set donation amount or have multiple suggested levels of giving. Choosing \"Multi-level Donation\" opens up the donation levels view where you can add as many levels as you'd like with your own custom names and suggested amounts. As well, you can allow donors to give a custom amount and even set up donation goals."

msgid "STEP 3: Add Additional Content"
msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/welcome.php:345
msgid "Every donation form you create with Give can be used on its own stand-alone page, or it can be inserted into any other page or post throughout your site via a shortcode or widget."
msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/welcome.php:347
msgid "You can choose these different modes by going to the \"Form Content\" section. From there, you can choose to add content before or after the donation form on a page, or if you choose \"None\" perhaps you want to instead use the shortcode. You can find the shortcode in the top right column directly under the Publish/Save button. This feature gives you the most amount of flexibility with controlling your content on your website all within the same page."

msgid "STEP 4: Configure Your Display Options"
msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/welcome.php:366
msgid "Lastly, you can present the form in a number of different ways that each create their own unique donor experience. The \"Modal\" display mode opens the credit card fieldset within a popup window. The \"Reveal\" mode will slide into place the additional fields. If you're looking for a simple button, then \"Button\" more is the way to go. This allows you to create a customizable \"Donate Now\" button which will open the donation form upon clicking. There's tons of possibilities here, give it a try!"
