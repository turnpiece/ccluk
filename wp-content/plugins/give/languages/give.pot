The version that is currently used for your site is no longer supported. Newer versions of PHP are both faster and more secure. In fact, your version of PHP no longer receives security updates, which is why we're sending you this notice."

msgid "You should update your PHP version to either 5.6 or to 7.0 or 7.1. On a normal WordPress site, switching to PHP 5.6 should never cause issues. We would however actually recommend you switch to PHP7. There are some plugins that are not ready for PHP7 though, so do some testing first. PHP7 is much faster than PHP 5.6. It's also the only PHP version still in active development and therefore the better option for your site in the long run."
