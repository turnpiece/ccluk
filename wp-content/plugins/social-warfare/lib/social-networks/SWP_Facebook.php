	 *
	 * As such, we have moved the share counts to the client side and we fetch
	 * those counts via javascript/jQuery. Now, instead of having 100 API hits
	 * being counted against the server's IP address, it will be counted against
	 * 100 different client/browser IP addresses. This should provide a virtually
	 * unlimited access to the non-authenticated API.

	 * You will also notice that these processes are conditonal on the plugin not
	 * being connected to Facebook. If the user has connected the plugin to Facebook,
