I rebuilt a big chunk of the plugin recently, and it turns out that I still had a call to one of the functions from the old version. It was a call to a PHP function that now no longer exists and has been replaced with a new function. I thought I had all of these replaced, but I had missed one.

We now hide all zeroes.</li><li>Update: Added a social media identity tab to the option page with new Facebook Publisher URL and APP ID fields.</li><li>Update: Floating buttons now appear with manually placed ones.</li><li>Performance: Improved the cache rebuild trigger.</li><li>Fix: Removed short links from Reddit Shares.</li><li>Fix: Filter Open Graph tags for Quation marks.</li><li>Fix: The Twitter 'Site' tag was being output twice.</li><li>Fix: Simple Podcast Press was outputting conflicting Open Graph tags.</li><li>Fix: The floating sidebar now hides properly on mobile.</li><li>Fix: The registration 'Infinite Loop' bug should now be gone for good.</li><li>Fix: The subtitles plugin was making the share title waaaaaay too long.</li></ul></p><p>1.3.17: A Pack of Minor Bug Fixes<ul><li>Fixed: The Pinterest image doesn't display properly when it's URL contain certain special characters.</li><li>Fixed: The 'Check Registration' function throws an error sometimes.</li><li>Fixed: The cache rebuild URL parameter begins with a question mark even when the URL already contains a question marked URL paremeter in front of it.</li><li>Fixed: The Yoast Facebook Author tag is being turned off when Open Graph tags have been filled in.</li><li>Fixed: Left floating buttons do not appear on WordPress pages, only on posts and other post types.</li><li>Fixed: On some iOS browsers, the click event for the buttons was not firing correctly.</li><li>Fixed: A typo in the admin_page_class.js was creating an 'Unexpected Expression' error.</li><li>Updated: Improved the logic of the algorithm that sizes the buttons.</li></ul></p><p>1.3.16: Changed the hosting location of the icon font.</p><p>1.3.15: Added some more Bitly failsafes, and modified some of the registration functions. Working on reducing API calls, and putting things in place so that if an API call fails, it does so more gracefully.</p><p>1.3.14: Upgrading some of the functions regarding Bitly and the Vertical Floating buttons.<ul><li>The Bitly integration is now smarter than ever. It only generates shortlinks during the background cache rebuild process so that whether it fails or not, there is no reduction in load time performance.</li><li>The floating buttons can now be turned on or off independent of the horizontal buttons. They can appear alongside the horizontal buttons or all by themselves. You can control this on the 'Display Locations' tab or on any post editor itself.</li></ul></p><p>1.3.13: Fixed a hiccup in the Bitly API that was causing it to not connect leading to prolonged page load times. Also, modified the trigger for resetting the cache to improve the way it functions with updating Open Graph images and whatnot.</p><p>1.3.12: Today's update linked to the wrong javascript file. This fixes that.</p><p>1.3.11: Improved the logic behind the Open Graph meta fields and the way that our plugin coordinates efforts with Yoast SEO when it is installed alongside of Social Warfare. <a target='_blank' href='http://warfareplugins.com/support/open-graph-twitter-cards-yoast-seo/'>Read More</a></p><p>1.3.10: Fixed an error code that was displaying in the last version and adjusted the alignment of side floating buttons when very little space is available in the margin of the page.</p><p>1.3.9: This version brings some huge performance optimizations. The goal is to make this plugin have as close as possible to absolutely no impact on the load time of posts and pages.<ul><li>1. New Feature: Added a shortcode generator for quickly and easily embedding share buttons directly into posts including share buttons that reflect a differnt page or post than what is being viewed.</li><li>2. New Feature: Upgraded the Click-to-Tweet shortcode generator. It now allows you to specify whether you want to use your default style or select a specific one for each instance.</li><li>3. Performance: Made it so that Google and other search engines are always served cached numbers so they always get the fastest version of the page.</li><li>4. Performance: Reduced database queries down to zero when serving cached data.</li><li>5. Performance: Eliminated the Click-to-Tweet CSS file and the image that was used for the icon cutting out 2 of the http requests.</li><li>6. Performance: Made it so the cache is rebuilt silently after the page has already completed loading. This means that all API requests and database calls are now conducted in a way that will never slow down the time it takes to generate and load the page for the user.</li><li>7. Performance: Several other modifications were made including how the html is generated for the buttons, how functions are called, and more that all help to reduce the performance footprint of this plugin as much as possible.</li></ul></p><p>1.3.8: Got the new Tumblr, Reddit, and StumbleUpon buttons back up and working. Lots of progress on this thing today! Woot! Woot!</p><p>1.3.7: Fixed the Google Plus share count glitch. They should now fetch counts properly again.</p><p>1.3.6: Fixed the buttons that were appearing at the top of some pages. Also fixed some conflicts that were occurring with the Yoast SEO plugin.</p><p>1.3.5: Fixed the performance issue that was introduced in yesterday's release. This thing should now be lightning fast again!</p><p>1.3.4: Fixed the buttons counts, hid the registration message (non-registered plugins will not have any features disabled until I can get this function to work properly), and the display locations should work properly again. Thanks for all your patience and terrific feedback!</p><p>1.3.3: Minor Bug Fix</p><p>1.3.2: Added support for Reddit, Tumblr, Email, and StumbleUpon buttons. Fixed some minor bugs. Also, this fixes the missing icons.</p><p>1.3.1: Minor Bug Fixes from Today's Update<ul><li>Fixed a 404 request to a javascript file.</li><li>Fixed the total shares on floating sidebars. They now hide properly when set to not show.</li><li>Fixed the excerpt from appearing in the header.</li></ul></p><p>1.3.0: This update packs a lot of cool new features. After updating, be sure to reset your caching plugins, especially anything that might be serving up cached, or outdated, javascript and CSS.<ul><li><b>Rebuilt the CSS for the visual themes and floating sidebar buttons. There are now thousands of shape, color and hover state combinations that can be created.</b></li><li><b>Added a new 'Boxed' version of the floating sidebar buttons.</b></li><li>Added the option to hide the share count numbers when a network is reporting zero shares on that network.</li><li>Refined the mobile sizing algorithm. The buttons will now show counts on mobile if it measures and determines that there is enough space to do so.</li><li>Modified the way buttons are sized so that if a site hides the content and then fades it into view using javascript, our plugin will now wait until it is visible prior to sizing them.</li><li>Added Frensh button translations.</li><li>Fixed an error that was causing the background of the floating share bar to always be white regardless of what color it was set to be.</li><li>Fixed the registration page infinite loop error.</li></ul><li>Reduced the size of the javascript from 34KB to 11KB for front-end page loads. </li></p><p>1.2.26:<ul><li>Added the ability to sort icons dynamically based on the number of shares for each network.</li><li>Fixed an issue wherein the buttons weren't showing up on home pages or blog archive feeds on some themes.</li><li>Changed it so that Pinterest images and URLs are not URL Encoded but the Pinterest descriptions are (important when special characters are included).</li><li>Fixed the default margin and border on the connected visual style.</li><li>Added a 'Rare Configurations' tab for certain bug fixes that are rarely encountered.</li><li>Modified the hover state of the total shares button so that it doesn't affect the totesalt class version of the button.</li></ul></p><p>1.2.25:<ul><li>Fixed an issue where some themes were changing the margin of our button container element.</li><li>Updated the float conditional statement so that it will now not only work on pages and posts, but also on Custom Post Types as well.</li><li>Updated the function that makes sure that share counts (like Pinterest) don't go back down or disappear entirely.</li><li>Cleaned up the old version of the 'Total Shares' button.</li><li>Updated the Z-index of the floating bar so that it doesn't get hidden on some themes.</li></ul></p><p>1.2.24: Bug fix for a misspelled function name.</p><p>1.2.23: Fixed an issue with Bitly caching old links and not updating when page URLs get modified. Also fixed an issue that was causing the buttons to show up on posts embedded inside other posts like on related posts at the bottom of content.</p><p>1.2.23: Updated the Google Plus icon and fixed a few minor bugs. Be sure to empty your caching plugins!<p><p>1.2.21: Fixed another javascript bug.</p><p>1.2.20: Minor bug fix.</p><p>1.2.19: Fixed to bugs. 1. Fixed a bug that broke the order of icons from working properly. You will need to resave your order preference after this update. 2. Fixed a bug that affected the registration process in some instances.</p><p>1.2.18: Updated the Custom Tweet counter logic to count links the same way that Twitter does.</p><p>1.2.17: Changed the way networks are enqueued for share count fetching. This fixes a minor bug, but also streamlines some of the development hooks and filters that we've been working on.</p><p>1.2.16: Fixed a broken javascript link that was making everything act crazy. Whoops!</p><p>1.2.14: Updated 2 class names to avoid CSS conflicts with other plugins or themes.</p><p>1.2.13: Added an option that should fix a bug that causes the share buttons to appear twice at the bottom of a page when user's have a visual editor installed via a plugin or theme rather than using the built-in WordPress editor.</p><p>1.2.12: Cleaned up the registration process some more. It should be more intuitive than ever now.</p><p>1.2.11: Some more subtle refinements of the Open Graph tags.</p><p>1.2.10: Rebuilt the registrations functions. Fixed a formatting issue with Twitter shares in the floating sidebar. Fixed some Open Graph tags issues.</p><p>1.2.9: Updated the way share recovery works.</p><p>1.2.8: Updated the Open Graph tags. Now if you don't provide the minimum required information, it won't output a partial Open Graph tag set. You'll need to have at least a featured image or the Social Media Image declared now.</p><p>1.2.7: Fixed a minor bug with the horizontal floating bars.</p><p>1.2.6: Updated the way share recovery works. If the recovered shares are identical to the current shares, we now assume that that particular network has already picked up on your 301 redirect and we do not add them together. Only if the share counts are different do we assume that they need recovered.</p><p>1.2.5: Updated the horizontal Floating Share Buttons for mobile.</p><p>1.2.4: Adjusted the way the buttons are sized on hover. It should be a much cleaner animation now.</p><p>1.2.3: This is another update packed with new features. Check this out:<ul><li>Updated the way Twitter cards work. Now if you don't have any images added, it will revert to the standard, non-image Twitter summary card.</li><li>Added a share recover system. If you've ever changed your permalink structure on your blog, you can now recover the shares that had been made on your previous URL structure.</li><li>Added a shortcode function that allows you to place Social Warfare buttons on any page, but reflect all settings (share counts, links, titles, descriptions, and images) of a different page. For example, you might want to place buttons on a 'Thank You For Subscribing' page, but you want to reflect the share counts of the actual 'Subscribe' call-to-action page. And more importantly, that the page you want your users sharing after they subscribe. This one can be powerful. Here's an example shortcode to show how it works: [social_warfare post_id=\"127\"]. The post_id field can be the ID of a post, page or any other custom post type that has a WordPress ID.</li><li>Fixed an issue with how the excerpt was being formatted for the open graph and Twitter card descriptions that was, in some cases, adding a 'Read More' html tag to the header of a page.</li><li>I've also expanded the amount of information that's output to the Open Graph tags. I've also ensured that our plugin coordinates intelligently with WordPress SEO by Yoast (when installed) when generating these open graph tags.</li><li>Fixed a typo in the CSS that was making the wrong font appear on the side floating buttons.</li><li>Added Dutch to the list of available languages courtesy of Daniel Philipsen. That means we now have 5 languages built in. Please contact us if you'd like to contribue a new language for us.</li></ul></p><p>1.2.2: This update is all about Twitter.<ul><li>Added Twitter Cards. Woot! Woot!</li><li>I've also added a 'Twitter Username' field to user's profiles. Now, if you want, you can add individual author usernames and have the 'via @username' point to the author of that post.</li><li>I also modified the behavior of the Open Graph tags. This should now work much, much better.</li></ul></p><p>1.2.1: Minor bug fix from the 1.2.0 upgrade.</p><p>1.2.0: This update has been a big push to create developer hooks that will hopefully get more developers involved and help to expand the available features through the creation of addons or functions.php recipes. In order to do this, we've been toiling behind the scenes rebuilding many files and functions from the ground up. Here's a look what this update brings with it:</p><ul><li>1. Changed the way the user's options selections are fetched drastically reducing database calls.</li><li>2. Changed the way the buttons are sized</li><li>3. Built in a multilingual functionality. There is currently only one language (Enlish), but now others can easily be added to the plugin. Feel free to send us translations that you would like to see added to the plugin.</li><li>4. Changed the way share counts are fetched. Previously each share count was fetched one at a time beginning the request as soon as the previous request was finished. Now all share requests fire off at the same time. This will drastically reduce the amount of time it takes to fetch new share counts when the cache on the existing counts expires.</li><li>5. Added a developer hook to allow additional link shortening integrations to be created.</li><li>6. Added a developer hook to allow additional analytics parameters to be used with Social Warfare.</li><li>7. Changed the priority of the Social Warfare function hook to fix the double share button bug.</li><li>8. Added developer hooks for adding options to the Social Warfare settings page and also to fetch the options that the user has set.</li><li>9. The developer hooks necessary to add additional social network share buttons are about 75% complete.</li><li>10. Adjusted some CSS to clean up the custom options display on the post editor.</li><li>11. Fixed some trailing commas in the javascript file that may have interfered with minifying the javascript.</li><li>12. Fixed an issue with the naming of our widget function to avoid conflicts with other plugins that were using the same naming pattern.</li><li>For more information about this update and our vision for the future, check out our blog post here: <a href='http://warfareplugins.com/social-warfare-1-2-developer-hooks-major-optimizations-and-bug-fixes/'>Social Warfare 1.2: Developer Hooks, Major Optimizations, and Bug Fixes.</a></li></ul><p>1.1.17 Fixed an issue that was creating a conflict with the native Pinterest plugin.</p><p>1.1.16 Changed the html structure of the buttons and click to tweets to coordinate with Postmatic.

Also added the options to be able to customize the source and campaign names for the tracking data.</p><p>1.0.23 Some themes are adding a text-shadow to the icons that make them look blurry.

Fixed a bug that was pushing the last button to a new line when the total shares is displayed on the left.</p><p>1.0.11 Fixed Pinterest UTM tracking Code, changed outlines to use transparent background instead of white background.</p><p>1.0.10 Fixed two minor bugs.</p><p>1.0.9 Added some checks that should help to avoid duplicate meta issues and help to optimize the database.</p><p>1.0.8 Fixed some link formatting issues related to the new Bitly integration.</p><p>1.0.7 Playing Wack-A-Mole: Smacked down another Bitly bug.</p><p>1.0.6 Custom color overlays were broken.
