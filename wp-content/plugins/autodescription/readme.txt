= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
This plugin is unbranded! This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page. This plugin makes great use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags. The small and hidden HTML comments can easily be disabled with the use of a filter or extension.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

= Completely automated =
**By default, this plugin automatically generates:**

* Titles according to Google's best practices.
* Descriptions with anti-spam techniques and detection that informs you when it can be improved.
* A canonical URL to prevent duplicated content; with full "domain mapping", subdomain, and HTTPS support.
* Various Open Graph, Facebook and Twitter tags.
* Special Open Graph descriptions, which organically integrates within the Facebook and Twitter snippets.
* Open Graph images, they are automatically resized and optimized when needed.
* Structured Data for Google Search and supported browsers that add extended on-site search support.
* Structured Data for Google's Knowledge Graph; like Personal/Business site relations, names, and logos.
* Structured Data for Breadcrumbs that extend pages and categories relationship support in Google Search.
* Publishing and editing dates for social sites and search engines alike.
* Paginated content relationship links, to help visitors going to the right page.
* A sitemap with all your pages, posts and CPT, which listens to their page settings.
* Feed excerpts and backlinks within, to reduce automated content theft.

**This plugin goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains, and Multisite domain mapping.
* Stops SEO attacks that are caused by pagination exploits in WordPress.
* Discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing, and Yandex on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.

= Generously personal =
**This plugin allows you to manually set various values for each post, page, public CPT, and term.**

**This plugin allows you to adjust over 100 site settings, including:**

* Automated title output options; they encourage you to follow the guidelines.
* Automated description output options.
* Schema.org structured data output options.
* Various robots meta output options.
* Many home page specific options.
* Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest social integration options.
* Google, Bing, Pinterest and Yandex webmaster verification codes.
* Sitemap integration with personalization.
* Robots.txt sitemap integration.
* Feed anti-scraper options.
* And many, many more settings.

= Openly pluggable =
The SEO Framework has been built to go further than just itself.
Take a look at the API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](http://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The SEO Bar =
**This plugin helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, duplicated, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

We call this the SEO Bar. Check out the screenshots below to see how it helps you!

= Hardcore caching =
This plugin's code is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more meta tags used.

A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference; however, it's supported wherever best suited.

= Compatibility =
**This plugin supports:**

* PHP 5.4 and greater.
* WordPress 4.6 and greater.
* Internationalization through WordPress.org.
* UTF-8 character calculation and rendering, including Emoji and CJK.
* Right to Left (RTL) languages, through its interface and generation.
* Extended color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility and keyboard navigation.
* Multisite setups, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Both up-to-date and outdated themes.
* Detection of various other popular SEO tools to help you prevent duplicated output.
* Translation plugins like WPML, Polylang, WPGlobus, and MultilingualPress.
* WooCommerce, for free, in all its glory.

= An additional sitemap =
The sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is more than sufficient for search engines to find posts, pages and supported custom post types throughout your website. It also listens to the "noindex" settings on each of the items and works great with various translation plugins.

Via Structured Data, like what's brought with the [Articles extension](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/articles/), advanced sitemaps are no longer needed.

However, if you require a more expanded sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) sitemap plugin is found.

= Hidden breadcrumbs =
The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included in the Sitemap of this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework Free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!
This plugin is all-inclusive without upsells.

= Is there more? =

For more advanced SEO options and output, we offer the free plugin [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell us about it.
We'll try to get back to you within 72 hours. :)

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

Any input is greatly appreciated, and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

= I want to modify how this plugin works. =

The SEO Framework is extensible. Please refer to the [API documentation](https://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not an issue. Search engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a search engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

Check out our [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).
It brings extensions, like Articles, that fill in the gaps with newer and better techniques.

= The sitemap contains unwanted links. =

The SEO Framework takes all publicly queryable posts, pages, and CPT and puts them in the sitemap.

If you don't want a page in the sitemap, consider enabling the `noindex` option. This will also remove the page from search engine result pages.

If the link shouldn't be in the sitemap because it's meant for structural reasons, then inform the plugin or theme author that created them.
You should tell the author to check out the "`public` and `rewrite` post type arguments". The plugin or theme author should know what that means.

= What's do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are search engine helpers which tell search engines how to connect and index the site.
They can tell the search engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.
This is also referred to as "Structured Data".

= The metadata is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

All The SEO Framework's metadata is put into Object cache when a caching plugin is available.
Please be sure to clear your cache or adjust the plugin's caching settings if deemed necessary.

= 3.1.0 - Pure =

*"The difference between something good and something great is attention to detail." - Charles R. Swindoll[†](http://dannybeckettjr.com/2009/10/220079492/)*

**Release date**

* September 15th, 2018

**Foreword**

We've written a [foreword on v3.1](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2490), it tells the story behind of what we've done. You should read it, so you'll know what to expect from this update.

**Feature highlights:**

* We completely redesigned the meta-titles generation, they support 114+ languages out of the box, and we’ve added new title adjustment features.
* We've vastly improved the meta-description generation code, it now supports all languages, it leaves out junk, and it’s faster than ever before.
* The SEO Bar is now more intelligent. It’s now aware of its WordPress, linguistic, and graphical environment, and it tells you more details.
* The pixel counter is now the most accurate guideline in its field. Hover over it, and you’ll find it gives you more information.
* Custom Post Type support is improved, and you can now easily manage various settings for them individually.
* The plugin's interface is now fully accessible with added keyboard navigation.
* ...and more than 700 other noteworthy changes, found in our [detailed log](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2562#detailed).

**Upgrade notes:**

* PHP 5.3 support has been dropped. Here's why:
	* PHP 5.3 hasn't received updates for [over 4 years](http://php.net/eol.php) and using it yields a major security risk.
	* Using PHP 5.4 lowers our time spent on maintenance, and it increases our productivity; so, we can focus on faster, better, and more useful solutions.
	* Learn more about [Upgrading PHP](https://wordpress.org/support/upgrade-php/).
* WordPress 4.4 and 4.5 support has been dropped. Here's why:
	* Although WordPress still brings security updates for versions as low as 3.7, [most users](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/) have upgraded to a newer version.
	* WordPress brings a slightly different yet vastly better developer environment with each major release. Supporting these will not only lower our maintenance and support time, but it also brings you a better experience.
	* Learn more about [Upgrading WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress).

*If, for whatever reason, you still wish to use PHP 5.3 and/or WordPress 4.4/4.5, [The SEO Framework 3.0.6](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/autodescription.3.0.6.zip) still supports them.*

**New and simplified API documentation**

After two years, we've finally updated our [API docs](https://theseoframework.com/docs/api/), go check it out.
