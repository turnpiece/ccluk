MailChimp Sync
==============

A WordPress plugin that synchronizes your WordPress Users with a selected MailChimp list. 

Installation
------------

Here's a [guide on how to install the plugin in your WordPress site](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-sync/installation/).
If you want to run the latest development version, you have two options:

* You can download the repository .zip file: [mailchimp-sync.zip](https://github.com/ibericode/mailchimp-user-sync/archive/master.zip)
* You can clone the GitHub repository using Git

This will download the latest development version of the MailChimp Sync plugin. While this version is usually stable,
it is not recommended for use in a production environment.

Note that this plugin depends on [MailChimp for WordPress](https://mc4wp.com/) (free or premium) to work, so you will need to install that plugin first.
