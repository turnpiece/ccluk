Combat spam registrations for a BuddyPress-powered site using Google's reCAPTCHA

== Description ==

> **Important**: Since version 2.0, this plugin now requires at least PHP 5.3. Please ensure you are running the latest available version of PHP on your server.

This plugin adds [Google's reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/) to the BuddyPress registration page and WordPress login page to prevent bots from registering and keep your site free from spam registrations.

reCAPTCHA is "tough on bots, easy on humans": while it is increbianle effective on preventing bots from registering, most of the time all the user needs to do to verify themselves is simply check a box.

After installing this plugin, you will need to [register your site with Google](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin) (requires a Google account) and enter the site key and secret key on the **Settings > BuddyPress > Options** admin menu. If you would prefer not to use Google's service, there is an alternative security check method also available; see below;

Prior to version 2.0, a less effective security check method was used where the user needed to answer simple math sum before registering. This method is still available, and can be turned on on the **Settings > BuddyPress > Options** menu.

You can learn more at the [plugin's website](https://bungeshea.com/plugins/bp-security-check/), or on [GitHub](https://github.com/sheabunge/bp-security-check)

== Installation ==

This plugin extends the functionality of [BuddyPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress), which must be installed for this plugin to work

1. Upload the `bp-security-check` directory to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins > Installed Plugins** menu in WordPress
2. Visit the **Settings > BuddyPress > Options** admin menu
3. If you want to use the more secure reCAPTCHA mode, you will need to [register your site with Google](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin) and enter the site and secret keys. Otherwise, choose the 'legacy math method' to turn on security checks.
