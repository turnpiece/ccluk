A lightweight WordPress shortcodes plugin.

== Description ==

When activated, this plugin will add a button to the WordPress text editor to easily insert shortcodes to your posts or pages.

**Included shortcodes:**

* Button - With many options including unlimited colors.
* Content Toggle - Maybe for an awesome FAQ page.
* Tabbed Content - Create tabbed sections for your content.
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) Icons - 500+ icons and counting.
* Animations - Wrap anything with the animation shortcode and watch it come alive.
* Google Map - Display a map for any location on any post or page. Requires a Google API key for new sites.
* Notification Box - Have certain sections of text stand out by creating notices or alerts.
* Text Highlight - Quickly highlight sections of text to help more important words stand out.
* Columns - Separate your content with multiple column options.
* Spacing - Add space between sections on the fly.
* Progress Bar - Display a sliding progress notification bar
