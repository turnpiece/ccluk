== Description ==

> <strong>New in 2.2.0:</strong><br>Easily select pages or posts where the cookie notification doesn't display. You now have complete control over which pages display a notification and which don't.<br>Close on scroll - optionally choose scrolling as closure method.

= Simple set up =
One of the most popular aspects of this plugin is its ease of use - simply install and activate the plugin to automatically add the cookie consent notification bar. There is no need to configure it. Upon activation, the plugin will create and populate a page on your website with information about your cookie policy. Your consent banner will also automatically link to the newly-created cookie policy page from the notification bar. So if you use the default settings, it takes only seconds to get up and running.

== Features ==
* Choice of dismissal method - on click, on scroll, or timed
* Choice of dismissal element - either button or 'x' close
* Option to show the notification on the first page only - subsequent pages visited by the user will not display the message
* Option to exclude selected pages and posts from displaying the notification
* Choice of position - either top or bottom bar, or floating in one of the corners of the screen
* Translation support
* Responsive
* Customization options - including the ability to update styles from within the customizer
* Inherits your theme styles where possible
* The option to use an absolute or external URL to link to for further information
* Set the cookie duration
* Set the cookie version - updating a version will reset the cookie on all user sites

= EU ePrivacy Directive =
We think this is the simplest but most effective method of dealing with the legislation.

The plug-in is a straightforward approach to help you comply with the EU regulations regarding usage of website cookies. A user to your site is presented with a clear, yet unobtrusive notification that the site is using cookies, and may then acknowledge and dismiss the notification, or click to find out more. The plug-in automatically creates a new page with pre-populated information on cookies and how to disable them, which you may edit further if you wish.

Importantly, the plug-in does not disable cookies on your site or prevent the user from continuing to browse the site.

== Installation ==
1. Simply install GDPR Cookie Consent Banner on your website from the WordPress plugin directory, or upload the `uk-cookie-consent` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in your WordPress backend
1. Navigate to the Cookie Consent page in your 'Settings' menu to configure your consent banner
