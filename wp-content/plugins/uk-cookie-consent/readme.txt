Simply install and activate the plugin, fill in your business info, scan your site for cookies and customize your settings to get a live cookie consent banner and compliant cookie policy on your site.

In addition, enable the Auto Blocker to automatically detect, categorize and block tracking scripts on your site from being served to your visitors until they have consented to it in accordance with their local laws and regulations. Unlike other tools, Termly maintains a database of thousands of known scripts and trackers so you don't need to think about set-up and can focus on building your site.

We'll automatically generate your cookie descriptions and categories, and keep your notification bar and policy up to date to help ensure compliance. No configuration needed.

= How does Termly's plugin help with data privacy legislation compliance? =

Laws like the [GDPR](https://termly.io/resources/articles/gdpr-cookies/), UK GDPR, [ePrivacy Directive](https://termly.io/faq/what-is-the-eu-cookie-law/), and UK's Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations have strict requirements about how websites can use cookies.

= Where can I find out more about the EU and UK laws regarding the use of cookies? =

You can find more details about EU and UK regulations like the Cookie Law on the [European Commission's](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-privacy) site, and the UK's PECR on the [Information Commissioner's](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/what-are-pecr/) Office site.

= Is the consent banner customizable? =

Yes, you can customize your consent banner to match the look and feel of your website. Edit the colors, theme, text, font, display style, and position using our banner settings editor.

= Do visitors need to consent to cookies to use my site? =

If you choose to display your consent banner as a top or bottom bar, or as a left- or right-side tooltip, users will be able to continue using your site without interacting with the consent banner. You can also set your banner to disappear when a user scrolls (scroll to consent function). However, if you choose to display your consent notification as a full-screen modal, users will need to interact with the notice before continuing to use your site.

= Will cookies on my site be blocked until a user gives consent to their use? =

Yes, if you enable auto-blocking through the plugin, non-essential cookies will be blocked until your site's visitors have consented to your use of cookies. To learn more about setting up and customizing auto-blocking, [read our developer's guide](https://help.termly.io/support/solutions/articles/60000688982).

= Is GDPR Cookie Consent Banner free? =

The base version of GDPR Cookie Consent Banner is free and includes all of the basic plugin features.
