Termly’s GDPR-CCPA Cookie Consent Banner is one of the easiest, most effective, and popular cookie consent plugins available for WordPress. Our Consent Management Platform (CMP) helps businesses comply with data privacy laws from around the world, including the GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy Directive, all U.S. state-level privacy laws, the UK’s PECR, and more. As a certified Google CMP Gold Partner, our cookie banner also fully integrates with Google Consent Mode v2 and Google Tag Manager (GTM).

Termly's CMP supports the IAB TCF v2.2 and provides users with a pre-populated list of both TCF Vendors and Google's Ad Tech Providers, with an option to enter in additional vendors as necessary.

Use our cookie scanner to identify, list, and define all cookies your website uses. Our CMP then creates a custom cookie consent banner and cookie policy for you to easily add to your website.

This Cookie Consent Banner is actively developed, tested, and maintained by a team of engineers, designers, and data privacy attorneys. Termly’s cookie banner and consent solutions receive consistently positive reviews in the industry — from small companies and budding startups to web development agencies, legal offices, and larger enterprises.

Our team works around the clock to ensure you don’t have to worry about your cookie banner or cookie policy while remaining compliant.

Laws like the [GDPR](https://termly.io/resources/articles/gdpr-cookies/), UK GDPR, [ePrivacy Directive](https://termly.io/faq/what-is-the-eu-cookie-law/), and UK's Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations have strict requirements about how websites can use cookies.

= Do visitors need to consent to cookies to use my site? =

If you choose to display your consent banner as a top or bottom bar, or as a left- or right-side tooltip, users will be able to continue using your site without interacting with the consent banner. You can also set your banner to disappear when a user scrolls (scroll to consent function).
