== Description ==

**Among the Top 7 most downloaded Genesis plugins ever :) Thank you!**

> With this **lightweight plugin** for the popular Genesis Framework you can very **easily modify** the (registered) **default layouts** for homepage, singular pages (for posts and pages), various archive sections, author pages, attachment pages, search results pages, the 404 page - all done via a new theme options page. Just look for it at the submenu: *Genesis > Layout Extras*.
>
> Version 2.0.0 is a complete rewrite regarding code optimizations and also new features:
> The plugin now optionally adds up to nine (9!) additional layouts. Also, you can optionally add Layouts meta box support for post types inpost screens which don't have it yet. Plus, Genesis Archive Settings for post types could be enabled as well. 
>
> As a smart bonus the plugin also includes the layout setting for the *bbPress 2.x* forum plugin which itself is compatible to Genesis. Also added is the layout setting for other plugins from the Genesis ecosystem or other third-party authors: for example *AgentPress Listings* which includes the custom post type 'listings' and the taxonomy 'features'. Just have a look on the below listings for full explanation.

**Please note:** The plugin requires the *Genesis Theme Framework* (GPL-2.0+), a paid premium product released by StudioPress/ Copyblogger Media LLC (via studiopress.com).

* For public custom post types with archive support, enable Genesis Archive Settings

= Special Advise: =
**Note:** This plugin has been tested with WordPress branches 3.6 and also 3.5 (and also before with 3.4+, 3.3+, 3.2+) without any issues. It also works within Multisite installs - single activated and network activated, too. Remember, running with latest versions of Genesis and WordPress is *always* recommended.

**Also Note:** Installed/ active Genesis Framework, AT LEAST version 1.8 or higher (1.9.2+ recommended!), is *required* for this plugin in order to work!

**Own translation/wording:** For custom and update-secure language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/genesis-layout-extras/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that, just use a language file like `genesis-layout-extras-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the tools on "Other Notes").

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why up to 9 new layout options, aren't the default one's enough? =
Good question, hehe :) -- Since you are absolutely not forced to use the new options you can disable all and set the settings meta box to not display (via "Screen options" tab on top right corner), so you won't even see them on the plugin's settings page.

If, however, you want some new - simplyfied or tweaked - *flavors of existing layouts*, then you might try one of the new options. So for example, the "Primary below Content" layout option is perfect for minimalistic one-column sites. Or the "Sidebars below Content" is great for content-oriented blogs and/or sites that want to drop the bloat from the SIDEbar and only offer a bit more stuff *below* the main content - in a nice 2-column outfit.


= I don't see the new layout options in the plugin settings, what's up? =
This could only be the case if your child theme (or another plugin or some code snippet...) has *un-registered* both Genesis default sidebars. Those two are needed for the layout options, so, if they are not there, you just cannot see and use my plugin's layout options.


= Are the alternate layouts responsive? =
Yes, they are! All is working like it should with minimal additions on CSS style rules (only what's really needed).


= Help, the new layouts look not good on my site (CSS...), what can I do? =
This may depend on the used CSS rules loaded via the plugin. Those rules are NOT based on specific child themes but use a "middle-of-the-road" general concept that is based on *percentage CSS values*. This way I can save a lot of (child theme specific) overhead.

This approach may work with a lot of the official child themes by StudioPress. Sure, not all! Just try, and if needed, add additional CSS rules to your child theme style sheet to tweak the plugin styles.

Also, you are free to not load the plugin styles at all (see plugin settings!). In that case you might add completely custom CSS styles to your child theme (or wherever, via another plugin or what...).


= You can modify the layout of the plugin's AgentPress Listings post type. What does this mean? =
Nothing spectacular, you just can set the layout option for the archive pages of the "listings" post type, plus for all terms of its built-in "features" taxonomy. - Of course, the plugin (and so the setting in there) could be used with the AgentPress child theme and also with any other Genesis child theme, so this setting might come in really handy ;-).


= I noticed that some (layout section) settings have no effect at all, what happens here? =
This has to do with priorities. In general, if there's a template for a specific page (archive) type, for example `image.php` for image attachment display, then Genesis & WordPress will always use that first for the content output AS LONG AS there's an layout setting function or filter in there. Only if there are no templates with layout settings found, the layout option settings will take full effect. So, if our example `image.php` has a layout filter set in this then has the higher priority but if there's no layout filter in there then the plugin's layout setting will take effect! - Well, if you experience such cases just leave these fields on "Genesis Default" and you're good to go :-). (You might call that a limitation of the plugin or whatever but that's the intended behavior of WordPress & Genesis.)


= What does the Additional Post Type support do? =
Nothing spectacular...

a) It just would add the inpost metaboxes of Genesis for layouts (whoa!), SEO (only if no SEO plugin is used) and Scripts (since Genesis 2.0+). --- That only works for post types that are "public" which means, viewable on the frontend!

b) Also possible, is the activation of the new Genesis Archive Settings (for post types; since Genesis 2.0+). So you can for example, edit the Archive Page Title, SEO Options and Layout Options for a 'download' archive page (or a 'books' archive, 'portfolio' archive...). --- That only works for post types that are "public" which means, viewable on the frontend AND have support enabled for `'has_archive' => true` in their post type registration!

Note: The layout settings for archives done via these Genesis Archive settings and/or the content archive settings of THIS plugin *do just the same*. So you decide which one you use. Nothing could break, and it does no harm. So, enjoy your content archives (settings)!


= What means Reset of settings? =
a) Layouts: Actually it just restores the default layout setting which is always defined in regular layout settings on the Genesis Theme Settings page.

b) All other settings are set to their default state.


= Which settings are effected when doing a reset? =
**ALL** available options are resetted to their defaults!
So if you for example only want to reset *one* option and leave all other as they are then only change this one section and then click the SAVE button and you're done.


= Is this plugin Multisite compatible? =
Yes, it is! :) Works really fine in Multisite invironment - here I just recommend to activate on a per site basis so to load things only where and when needed.


= In Multisite, could I "network activate" this plugin? =
Yes, you could. -- Still, a per site use is recommended. -- Network activation makes the most sense if *all* sub sites are using Genesis! On the other hand, if your Multisite install has 10 sites and only 3 may run with Genesis, network activation is not recommended!


= How could I add my own layout option to the select drop-down menu? =
That's possible since plugin version 2.0.0! Handy feature for custom child theme development as well as for plugin developers, hehe :)

Just use this sample code and modify/ enhance to your needs:

		);

	}  // function

}  // if
`


= How can I remove the Export/ Import Info meta box? =
Just add this line of code to your child theme's `functions.php` file, a functionality plugin or snippet management plugin:
`
/** Genesis Layout Extras: Remove Export/ Import Info meta box */
define( 'GLE_NO_EXPORT_IMPORT_INFO', TRUE );
`


= How can I completely remove the 'Header+Nav/Content/Sidebar' layout option? =
It's possible, yes, just add this line of code to your child theme's `functions.php` file, a functionality plugin or snippet management plugin:
`
/** Genesis Layout Extras: Remove HNCS layout option */
define( 'GLE_NO_HNCS_LAYOUT_OPTION', TRUE );
`


All the custom & branding stuff code above can also be found as a Gist on GitHub: https://gist.github.com/deckerweb/6151740 (you can also add your questions/ feedback there :)

= 1.2.0 (2011-12-22) =
* Added new help tab system for WordPress 3.3 -- this time the plugin is also still compatible with old contextual help prior WP 3.3 but PLEASE NOT that I will remove this soon and then the plugin will require WordPress 3.3+ so please update now your WordPress installation!
* Bugfix: Wrapped conditional around `genesis_get_option` function to allow error-free theme changing (from Genesis to a non-Genesis theme) -- Please note: this also fixes the Multisite errors when plugin is network activated! -- Props to WP.org user "greghile" for reporting the Multisite issue!
* Minor code and code documentation improvements
* Wording: Changed strings "bbPress 2.0" to "bbPress 2.x" to reflect ongoing development & releases of that forum plugin

* Updated included .pot file (`genesis-layout-extras.pot`) for translators
* Added banner image on WordPress.org for better plugin branding :)

= 1.1.0 (2011-10-06) =
* Improved homepage layout setting with adding the conditional statement `is_front_page()` so also static pages set as homepage (in WordPress: Settings > Reading) are now supported!
* Added new specific date layout options for Year, Month, Day - please note, that the general date setting will overwrite the other three settings (these have lower priority) - so, when in doubt, only use the general setting or leave on default
* Updated help texts where needed
* Added new user questions to FAQ section here
* Updated German translation files
* Updated included .pot file (`genesis-layout-extras.pot`) for translators
* Some more minor code tweaks and cosmetic changes :)

* New and forked version of the plugin under new name and authorship by David Decker of deckerweb.de and GenesisThemes
* Updated, improved and documented code

* Added new layout options for attachment page, bbPress Forum and AgentPress Listing custom post type
* Added contextual help - tab on the top right corner of the options page
* Added settings link to the plugin page section
* Fully localized the plugin, working out of the box!
* Added German translations (English included by default)

**Easy plugin translation platform with GlotPress tool:** [**Translate "Genesis Layout Extras"...**](http://translate.wpautobahn.com/projects/genesis-plugins-deckerweb/genesis-layout-extras)

*Note:* All my plugins are internationalized/ translateable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide. So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful. For translating I recommend the awesome ["Codestyling Localization" plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/codestyling-localization/) and for validating the ["Poedit Editor"](http://www.poedit.net/), which works fine on Windows, Mac and Linux.

== Future Roadmap for Genesis Layout Extras ==
* Adding more supported plugins that come with post types
* If it makes sense, maybe even add more layout options...
* When needed, adding more supported child themes
* In general, improving the code and overall user experience
* Hopefully, I can even offer more translations in future :)

== Additional Info ==
**Security:** The plugin uses the Genesis Sanitization class for checking and filtering all custom inputs. Further, the plugin uses WordPress and Genesis Framework APIs and coding standards to the highest possible extend. Just to make sure you get a quality, future-proof product.

**Idea Behind / Philosophy:** I had liked the general approach of the former plugin (I forked from) - which provided a simple and great way to set a few needed options. Since it seemed no longer to be developed and updated I just decided to make a fork of it and add some additional functionality like setting the layout setting for the (awesome!) bbPress 2.x forum plugin in Genesis. And, I wanted this all on an extra options page, divided from the general Genesis settings because that is much more user friendly IMHO. In addition I added full inline documentation including the contextual help function provided by WordPress itself to create a more seamless user experience.

== Credits ==

**Among the Top 7 most downloaded Genesis plugins ever :) Thank you all users and translators!**

**Thanks for all user feedback that led to improvements in the plugin!**

**Big thanks to all Genesis users, developers and bloggers who reviewed the plugin on their websites/ blogs!**

*Credit where credit is due:* This plugin here was first based on the work of WPChildThemes for the great "Genesis Layout Manager" plugin. Now, nearly two years and a dozen updates later the basic function is still there but the code totally refactored...! :)

== Last but not least ==
**Special Thanks go out to my family for allowing me to do such spare time projects (aka free plugins) and supporting me in every possible way!**
